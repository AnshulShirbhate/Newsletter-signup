# Newsletter-signup
This is a newsletter signup form made by me with the help of HTML ,CSS ,Java-Script ,and Mailchimp's API. 

Hello Guys!
Myself Anshul and I am here to guide you on how to make this work on your local environment.

(Note: "You should be familiar with the Mailchimp's website to get this project work for yourself.")

1. Download this repository.
2. unzip
3. (On your terminal with node installed) npm install inside the directory after unziping.
4. signup for mailchimp and get your api key and list id.
5. replace the api key and list id with your own api key and list id in the app.js file.
6. node app.js on terminal to start the app.
